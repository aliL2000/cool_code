## Vectors vs. Lists

Python is renowned for its simplicity and readability, but one of its most notable drawbacks is its runtime inefficiency. When compared to languages like C, Java, and C++, Python tends to exhibit slower execution speeds. This performance gap is primarily attributed to Python's interpreted nature, dynamic typing, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which restricts true multithreading capabilities in CPython, the most widely used Python implementation.

Given this inherent limitation, prioritizing the understanding and utilization of efficient data structures and algorithms becomes imperative for Python programmers. The choice of data structure and algorithm can significantly impact program performance and execution time. Therefore, developers often find themselves navigating a delicate trade-off between Python's ease of use and the need for optimized runtime efficiency.

The objective of this mini-project is to delve into the quantitative aspects of this trade-off. Specifically, we aim to investigate the discernible differences in execution times when employing different data structures within Python.
